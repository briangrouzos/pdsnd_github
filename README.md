### Project Title
BikeShare Data Analysis Project

### Description
The project took three csv files of bikeshare data for Chicago, Washington, and New York and created dataframes
to compare the data using various statistical analysis.

The code took inputs for which file to review, what month of data to analyze, and what day of the week
to analyze. A collection of pre-determined statistics were generated and an option for raw data showing
5 lines at a time was provided.

### Files used
bikeshare_2.py
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv


### Credits
I used various stack overflow and similar posts about individual components to solve certain problems but I
did not use any information that covered this particular project.
